# ros_motor_controller_driver
A motor controller driver created in cpp, and wrapped using ROS:Noetic!

## How to use:
* The 'robot_driver' package is to be placed in the 'src' directory of your catkin workspace.

## Background:
* I wanted to become more familiar with ROS, so I decided to make a ROS wrapper for a cpp motor controller driver!
